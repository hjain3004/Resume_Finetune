# DECISIONS.md — approved deviations & verified facts

One dated entry per decision/finding. Newest last.

## 2026-07-04 — vanshb03/New-Grad-2027 verification (M1)

- Default branch is `dev`, not `main`. Hardcoded in `discover/tracker_vansh.py`.
- A machine-readable listings file exists at `.github/scripts/listings.json`
  (confirmed via `GET /repos/vanshb03/New-Grad-2027/contents/.github/scripts`).
  Per ARCHITECTURE §5.2 this is preferred over the README table. Schema (list of
  objects): `date_updated` (unix ts), `url`, `company_name`, `title`,
  `locations` (list[str]), `sponsorship`, `active` (bool), `source`, `id`,
  `date_posted` (unix ts), `company_url`, `is_visible` (bool). Rows are treated
  as closed/skip when `active` is `false` or `is_visible` is `false`.
- README table (fallback path, kept in sync for when/if the JSON disappears):
  header `| Company | Role | Location | Application/Link | Date Posted |`,
  matches ARCHITECTURE §5.2 exactly. Closed rows render `🔒` in the
  Application/Link cell instead of an `<a href>` — no URL, so these are
  skipped. No live `↳` (inherited-company) rows were observed in the current
  table, but the parser still implements inheritance defensively since the
  format is documented by the repo's own legend.
- Real README (`dev` branch, as fetched) saved as
  `tests/fixtures/vansh_readme.md`. A trimmed (30-row) real sample of
  `listings.json` saved as `tests/fixtures/vansh_listings.json`, plus a
  `vansh_listings_plus2.json` variant with 2 additional synthetic rows for the
  snapshot-diff test.
